# Term-do
This is a small terminal application for tracking tasks and also my first Rust project!

This might not be the most complete and complex task application for terminal ever, but it does a perfect job!

Controls are specified inside the application by pressing '?'.

Configuration is coming in the version 0.6!

I've been using this app during the development of this app, and it is really useful for software development in general.

Any error you find you can contact me, and I'll try to fix it as soon as possible!
